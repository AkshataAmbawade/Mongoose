$and
Joins query clauses with a logical AND returns all documents that match the conditions of both clauses.
(Both the conditions to be true then only display the output)

$not
Inverts the effect of a query expression and returns documents that do not match the query expression.
(it reverse the conditions)

$nor
Joins query clauses with a logical NOR returns all documents that fail to match both clauses.
(The logical or operator used to display the output if any one condition is true here in the logical nor operator it will reverse the condition like it will display the output where both the conditions are not present)

$or
Joins query clauses with a logical OR returns all documents that match the conditions of either clause.
(if one condition is true then also it will display)
