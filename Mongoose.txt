Q.What is Mongoose 
--> It helps us to establish a connection between the NodeJs and mongodb

-Mongoose is an Object Data modeling(ODM) library for mongodb and NodeJs . It manages relationship between data , provides schema validator, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those object is MongoDb






First create a Mongoose folder then inside that folder create one more folder named it as src inside src create app.js
Now initialized npm   by using command ===> npm init
Then install Mongoose by using command ===>npm i mongoose

Then in app.js 
-First require mongoose
-Second connect mongoose with localdatabase by using command mongoose.connect("mongodb://   localhost:27017/databaseName")
this will return pormise to avoid that use 
-Third use .then to avoid getting an pormise
.then(()=>{
    console.log("print whatever you want)
})
-Fourth to show the erroe we will use catch
.catch((err)=>{
    console.log(err)
})
-fifth create schema 
const nameList = new mongoose.Schema({})

-Sixth create model /collection 
 const Namelist = new mongoose.model("Namelist", nameList)
 -create document(refer app.js)
-Seventh Read document


refer to app.js for EG
