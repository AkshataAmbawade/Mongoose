Mongoose Populate() Method


In MongoDB, Population is the process of replacing the specified path in the document of one collection with the actual document from the other collection.

Need of Population: Whenever in the schema of one collection we provide a reference (in any field) to a document from any other collection, we need a populate() method to fill the field with that document.

Example: In the following example, we have one userSchema and another postSchema, in the postSchema we have one field postedBy which references a document from the User model.

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    email: String
})

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    postedBy: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "User"
    }
})

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);
